title: GSoC Week#6
---

Post midterm period of GSoC. This week I will focus on non-collab UX stuffs like:

* replacing hack added to sugar-datastore
* don't show the project jobject in the project-listview
* Copy a file from outside the project into inside the project
* Change the title of the project
* save the project description
* remove the details view for the project
* if I have a jobject from an activity in a project (eg. downloads from browse, photos from record), the "child object" should be in the project
