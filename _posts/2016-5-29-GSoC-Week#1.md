title: Revising the Timeline

The first week of coding. Week full of road blocks and battles :D No internet connection for 3 days. I had to switch to less effiecient alternative this had an impact on my work effieciency. But I still manage to meet my weekly deadline beforehand.
I am glad to work with the community who gives attention to GSoC interns :) Lucky to have mentor like Sam who is regularly asking me about my progress.
This week I have implemented the project-list view and design a metadata for projects. My progress can be tracked on https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar/compare/master...AbrahmAB:gsoc-projectlist-view Looking forward to work on the main **Project(mini-journal)** in the coming week.
Wishing myself good luck :P
